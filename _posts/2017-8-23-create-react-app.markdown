# This post is based on my personal experiences.

I was wondering that, whether there is simple way to create react project.
and finally found out there is a thing called "create-react-app".
it is simple but powerful for react project creation.

How to install?
  * npm install -g create-react-app

after, installation type "create-react-app <nameOfProject>"

it will generate react project.
