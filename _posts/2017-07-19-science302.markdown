# This post is based on my personal experiences.

 * this post is also belongs to my personal summarization.

"NPM" has virous option lists. but here I write some command that commonly used.


*npm install -g (name of Module)
if you are going to use module commands on terminal then go for global installation.

*npm install (name of Mudule)
instead of using global installation, you can use it as local installation.

* npm ls -g
list of global installations will be displayed.

npm ls
list of local installations will be displayed.
