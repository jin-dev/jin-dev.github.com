This post is based on my personal experiences.

before I start posting, I assume that "NPM" is already installed.
This post shows you, how to start node.js with "Hello World"
1.  create "myapp" folder (mkdir myapp)

2. type "npm init"

3. install "express" (npm install express --save)

4. create js file(app.js)

5. type following codes

6. after writing codes, run node and execute your codes (node app.js)

7. you will see the final output on localhost:3000(default)
