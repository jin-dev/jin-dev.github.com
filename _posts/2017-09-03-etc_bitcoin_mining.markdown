This could be a bit late but I just started bitcoin mining.

In my personal research there are 2 general ways for the mining.

1. DIY
2. cloude mining Service System

In my case, I would like to do DIY but unfortunately second option(Cloude mining service system) was my decision.

There are many cloude mining service systems but biggest popular services are genesis mining and Hash Flare.

In my ways

1. Go to genesis mining
2. Register it
3. make it pay (USD 150 for 1.0000 TH/s curretnly)


that's all for now!
