This post is based on my personal experiences.

on my previous post I wrote how to use Bootstrap with React.
However, I'm sure that was not enough why we have to use Bootstrap with React.
Therefore to understand the reason of using Bootstrap, Here I post two different photos.

1.  first one is simple icon with Bootstrap.

2.  Second one is simple icon without Bootstrap.

3. Now I'm sure you can find out major difference defending on Boostrap.
the following photo is a code for without React(for references)
